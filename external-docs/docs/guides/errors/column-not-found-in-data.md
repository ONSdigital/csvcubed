# Error - column not found in data

## When it occurs

A column mapping is defined in the JSON configuration file which is not present in the data CSV.

## How to fix

Ensure that your column mappings and CSV column titles are in agreement, including capitalisation. If a column is defined in the column mappings, then it must also be present in the data CSV.
