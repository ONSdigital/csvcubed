|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CSVW_METADATA_JSON_PATH | The file path to the JSON-LD metadata file of a CSV-W generated by the [build](./build-command.md) command. |

**Options**

| Option      | Description                                                                                                      |

| --log-level | Set the desired logging level to one of 'crit', 'err', 'warn', 'info' and 'debug'.  <br/> The default is 'warn'. |

## Logging

Please refer to the [Logging](./logging.md) section to know how the logging works in the inspect command.

## Input types

The inspect command takes data cubes and code lists that are provided in one of two specialised forms of tidy data (i.e. [standard shape](./../../guides/shape-data/index.md#standard-shape) and [pivoted shape](./../../guides/shape-data/index.md#pivoted-shape)) as inputs.
  
## Output format

In the following, the format of the outputs generated by the inspect command is discussed.
